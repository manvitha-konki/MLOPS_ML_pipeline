Building pipeline: 
    1. Add experiments, src folder along with all components
    2. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
    3. git add, commit, push


Setting up dvc pipeline (without params):
    1. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it
    2. dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
    ("dvc repro" -> reproduce the pipeline ==> This command will reproduce the entire pipeline, 
    starting from the root stages and only executing those that require an update.)
    3. git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (with params)
    1. Adding param.yaml
    2. Add the params setup
    3. Do "dvc repro" again to test
    4. git add, commit, push
