Building pipeline: 
    1. Add experiments, src folder along with all components
    2. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
    3. git add, commit, push


Setting up dvc pipeline (without params):
    1. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it
    2. dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
    ("dvc repro" -> reproduce the pipeline ==> This command will reproduce the entire pipeline, 
    starting from the root stages and only executing those that require an update.)
    3. git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (with params)
    1. Adding param.yaml
    2. Add the params setup
    3. Do "dvc repro" again to test
    4. git add, commit, push

Experiments with DVC
    1. pip install dvclive
    2. Add the dvclive code block
    3. Do "dvc exp run", it will create a new dvc.yaml(if not exists) and dvclive directory
    4. Do "dvc run show" to see experiments or use extensions on vscode
    5. Change params and try produce new experiments
    6. Git add, commit, push
