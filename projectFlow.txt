Building pipeline: 
    1. Add experiments, src folder along with all components
    2. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
    3. git add, commit, push


Setting up dvc pipeline (without params):
    1. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it
    2. dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
    ("dvc repro" -> reproduce the pipeline ==> This command will reproduce the entire pipeline, 
    starting from the root stages and only executing those that require an update.)
    3. git add, commit, push
